# Classifying State of The Union Speeches with scikit-learn KNN implementation

Here we use sklearn to preform K Nearest Neighbor classification of text chunks in order to determine the orator of the speech the text was taken from. 

In this instance, the speeches we are pulling text from are State of the Union Addresses given between 1993 and 2019, meaning that we have 4 potential classifications:
1. George W. Bush
2. Bill Clinton
3. Barack Obabma 
or 
4. Donald Trump

Transcripts of these speeches are avaialble at [govinfo.com](https://www.govinfo.gov/features/state-of-the-union)
